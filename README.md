# An Introduction to [Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/)

Code and notes from the egghead.io [Cycle.js Fundamentals](https://egghead.io/series/cycle-js-fundamentals) videos.

This project started out as a reference and playground for Cycle.js.  In the process of putting this project together I began to experiment with different build tools.  You will find a branch for each. 

1. Master, is my crude home grown build 

2. [Budo](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo) 

3. live-reload [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) 

4. [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org)


Develop: `npm run watch`, [Open in browser](http://localhost:8080)

Test: `npm test`

Build: `npm run build`
